I just got a model of the Alexander Dennis Enviro500 in SGBUS livery. It looks quite nice and considering there are only 50 of such buses in regular transport use around the world, it is one of the rarer models out there.

I still prefer the MAN A95 due to the panaromic upper-deck windshield, and suspension, but the Enviro500 beats it in terms of the three-door implementation with a full flat floor all the way to the rear-most exit.
