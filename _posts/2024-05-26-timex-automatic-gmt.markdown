Timex has finally released a watch - [Timex x James Brand GMT Automatic](https://timex.com/products/timex-x-the-james-brand-gmt-41mm-titanium-bracelet-watch-box-set-twg065500) - using the Miyota 9075 movement, which is a 'traveller' GMT movement where the hour hands are set by jumping in 1 hour increments/decrements.

It's has titanium case and bracelet, though I have no idea which grade it is made of.

Case is 41mm. Design-wise, it looks alright; very monochromic.

To me, comparable competition goes to the RZE Watch's Fortitude GMT.
