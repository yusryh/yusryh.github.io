![A screenshot of Darkenstein 3D in action](/assets/images/darkenstein_3d.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Here's a really cool retro game that I came across during my regular web browsing. Looks quite impressive for a solo developer and published by a name I've not heard in a long time - Microprose.

Best of all it is free and can be obtained from their [Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2195910/Darkenstein_3D/). Read more about it over at [Microprose](https://www.microprose.com/games/darkenstein-3d/).
