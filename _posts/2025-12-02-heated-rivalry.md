So.... I've watched the opening two episodes of Heated Rivalry, a much-talked show in the gay Internet space. It's kind of nice. Very gratuitous sex scenes and covered nudity; corny dialogue; and of course, the two very hot male leads.

I couldn't wait for the remaining episodes to be released and decided to reads the book themselves - Heated Rivalry (the book) and the follow up, The Long Game. If there's a season 2 of the series, The Long Game is probably the related book as I think Season 1 only covers what was in Heated Rivalry (the book).
