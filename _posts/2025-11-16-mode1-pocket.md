I've always been a fan of small phones and was considering buying a [Bluefox NX1](https://aiphor.com/products/bluefox-nx1-4-0-android-smartphone) which is a small phone with a 4.0" screen.

Then I came across this Japanese [Mode1 Pocket](https://mode1.jp/home/products/md07p) which is closer in size to the iPhone 12/13 Mini, which I think is a more comfortable size as it's closer in size to my very Nexus S.

Unfortunately, I'm not sure how great Bluefox's update cycles will be; as well as the Mode1 Pocket being a Japan model, so I guess I won't be getting these any time soon.
