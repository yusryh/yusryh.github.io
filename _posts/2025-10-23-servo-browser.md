So version 0.0.1 of the Servo browser was just released recently and I played around with it. Still buggy-ish rendering many websites, but it reminds me of the excitement I had when Mozilla Phoenix (before it was renamed to Firebird and thereafter, to Firefox) was initially released circa 2002.

Give it a go and you can find binaries for various platforms over at [their Github release page](https://github.com/servo/servo/releases).
